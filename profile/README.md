Welcome to the Kubernetes on Hybrid Cloud Community Group!

This group is open to everyone â€” whether you're an experienced Kubernetes professional, a contributor, or just starting your cloud-native journey. Our goal is to connect people and organizations who are solving the challenges of running Kubernetes in hybrid cloud environments.

A hybrid cloud environment combines on-premises, public cloud, and edge resources in one Kubernetes cluster. However:
- Kubernetes and its add-ons are usually made for one type of environment, not mixed setups.
- Many companies modify the code to work in hybrid clouds.
- They must update and fix their code again every time a new Kubernetes version is released.

This work is often repeated by different groups, and their solutions are not shared with others. Or those changes are very hard to find.

## Our goals

- Share knowledge and experience about Kubernetes in hybrid environments.
- Work together to solve common problems.
- Help bring good solutions back to the main Kubernetes project and components (upstream).
- Build a friendly community where people can help each other.
